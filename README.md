# Extra-Life-Parser

Requires Node JS and the "request" module

Edit variables specific to your Extra Life campaign in server.js and run in a CMD window. Code will output text files that can then be used as a part of an overlay on programs like Streamlabs OBS.

Currently contains specific functions for Final Fantasy XIV donation games. Will split these out later.

Please note: this is a rough, early build.
